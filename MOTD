NOTE: The official and community repositories have been shifted to b3sum
      checksums. Running `kiss U` should be enough to complete the transition.

NOTE: sha256 checksums have been preserved for `b3sum` and `kiss` to allow
      updating old systems. In order to rebuild them, they must temporarily be
      forked with `kiss fork` and `kiss checksum` and rebuilt until their
      checksums are updated to b3sum checksums.
