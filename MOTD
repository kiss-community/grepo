NOTE: The official and community repositories have been shifted to b3sum
      checksums. Running `kiss U` should be enough to complete the transition.

NOTE: sha256 checksums have been preserved for `b3sum` and `kiss` to allow
      updating old systems. In order to rebuild them, they must temporarily be
      forked with `kiss fork` and `kiss checksum` and rebuilt until their
      checksums are updated to b3sum checksums.

NOTE: libcrypt files might be absent after updating to glibc 2.38, this is
      caused by alternatives being created when installing libxcrypt on
      older glibc, so either rebuild libcrypt, or run the following command
      to restore alternatives to point to libxcrypt:

          `kiss a | grep libxcrypt | kiss a -`
