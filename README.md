## Installation

Follow the steps mentioned on the [KISS Linux](https://kisslinux.org/install) website, making a few changes:

* Download the latest GKISS tarball from https://github.com/gkisslinux/grepo/releases instead of the KISS tarball.

* The `KISS_PATH` should be set as follows - with `grepo` instead of `repo`:

```sh
REPODIR="$HOME/Repos" # Example, set this accordingly

export KISS_PATH=""
KISS_PATH="$KISS_PATH:$REPODIR/grepo/core"
KISS_PATH="$KISS_PATH:$REPODIR/grepo/extra"
KISS_PATH="$KISS_PATH:$REPODIR/grepo/wayland"
KISS_PATH="$KISS_PATH:$REPODIR/community/community"
```

* In order to rebuild `glibc`, the KISS [Community repository](https://github.com/kiss-community/repo-community) needs to be enabled.

* Generate locales by running `locale-gen` as root after modifying the `/etc/locale.gen` file with the appropriate locales separated by newlines (`en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8` for most users) and add `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8` to `/etc/profile`.

## NVIDIA

**TIP:** `mesa` can be built without `llvm` on NVIDIA systems, look [here](https://codeberg.org/git-bruh/kiss-repo/src/branch/master/overrides/mesa/build) for an example.

* Install the nvidia drivers by building the `nvidia` package.

* For kernel configuration, refer to the [Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/NVIDIA/nvidia-drivers#Kernel_compatibility). The `nouveau` kernel module must either be blacklisted from being loaded or disabled in the kernel configuration.

* The kernel modules can also be built for a specific kernel by exporting the `KERNEL_UNAME` variable:

```sh
export KERNEL_UNAME=5.10.2 # Example
kiss b nvidia
# Environment variables can't be used in `post-install`.
depmod "$KERNEL_UNAME"
```

* For Wayland compositors to work properly, the NVIDIA kernel module _MUST_ be loaded with the GSP firmware (To avoid flickering) and the `modeset` parameter enabled:

```sh
# tee /etc/rc.d/nvidia.boot <<EOF
/bin/modprobe nvidia NVreg_OpenRmEnableUnsupportedGpus=1 NVreg_EnableGpuFirmware=1 NVreg_EnableGpuFirmwareLogs=1
/bin/modprobe nvidia-drm modeset=1
EOF
```

If the firmware was loaded correctly, the following command should output the driver version instead of `N/A`:

```sh
$ nvidia-smi -q | grep GSP
    GSP Firmware Version                  : 515.48.07
```

* Additionally, disable hardware cursors for wayland compositors to avoid flickering by adding the following command to `~/.profile`:

```sh
export WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS=1
```

## Reporting Issues

Any build failures/segfaults encountered with packages from GKISS/KISS repositories should be reported in the form of an issue on this repository.
