busybox
________________________________________________________________________________

BusyBox is a software suite that provides several Unix utilities in a single
executable file. It runs in a variety of POSIX environments such as Linux,
Android, and FreeBSD, although many of the tools it provides are designed to
work with interfaces provided by the Linux kernel. It was specifically created
for embedded operating systems with very limited resources. The authors dubbed
it "The Swiss Army knife of Embedded Linux", as the single executable replaces
basic functions of more than 300 common commands. [0]

[002] Usage
________________________________________________________________________________

KISS' default busybox configuration comes with upwards of 300 utilities (all
contained in less than a single megabyte). There are many more utilities and
options which are also currently disabled.

Busybox does not provide manual pages for each of its commands. Instead it only
provides help output (--help). The POSIX manual pages can be installed to fill
in some of these documentation holes.

--[003] Services ---------------------------------------------------------------

  The busybox package provides various daemons and also accompanying service
  files for the default service manager. The following daemons have services
  provided by the distribution.

  * acpid     - Simple ACPI events listener
  * crond     - Daemon to execute scheduled commands.
  * mdev      - A device manager.
  * ntpd      - Network Time Protocol Daemon.
  * syslogd   - System logging daemon.

  Refer to the distribution's service management documentation. [1] If busybox
  provides a daemon but no service file is provided, open an issue at
  $/kisslinux/repo and a service will be added.
