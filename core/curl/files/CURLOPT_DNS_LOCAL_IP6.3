.SH NAME
CURLOPT_DNS_LOCAL_IP6 \- IPv6 address to bind DNS resolves to
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_DNS_LOCAL_IP6, char *address);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Set the local IPv6 \fIaddress\fP that the resolver should bind to. The argument
should be of type char * and contain a single IPv6 address as a string. Set
this option to NULL to use the default setting (do not bind to a specific IP
address).

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.

Using this option multiple times makes the last set string override the
previous ones. Set it to NULL to disable its use again.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL
.SH PROTOCOLS
This functionality affects all supported protocols
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
int main(void)
{
  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    CURLcode res;
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/foo.bin");
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_DNS_LOCAL_IP6, "fe80::a9ff:fe46:b619");
    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
    curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
  }
}
.fi
.SH NOTES
This option requires that libcurl was built with a resolver backend that
supports this operation. The c\-ares backend is the only such one.
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in curl 7.33.0
.SH RETURN VALUE
\fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP returns a CURLcode indicating success or error.

CURLE_OK (0) means everything was OK, non\-zero means an error occurred, see
