.SH NAME
CURLOPT_LOGIN_OPTIONS \- login options
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_LOGIN_OPTIONS, char *options);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char pointer as parameter, which should be pointing to the
null\-terminated \fIoptions\fP string to use for the transfer.

For more information about the login options please see RFC 2384, RFC 5092 and
the IETF draft \fBdraft\-earhart\-url\-smtp\-00.txt\fP.

\fICURLOPT_LOGIN_OPTIONS(3)\fP can be used to set protocol specific login options,
such as the preferred authentication mechanism via "AUTH=NTLM" or "AUTH=*",
and should be used in conjunction with the \fICURLOPT_USERNAME(3)\fP option.

Since 8.2.0, IMAP supports the login option "AUTH=+LOGIN". With this option,
curl uses the plain (not SASL) LOGIN IMAP command even if the server
advertises SASL authentication. Care should be taken in using this option, as
it sends your password in plain text. This does not work if the IMAP server
disables the plain LOGIN (e.g. to prevent password snooping).

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.

Using this option multiple times makes the last set string override the
previous ones. Set it to NULL to disable its use again.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL
.SH PROTOCOLS
This functionality affects imap, ldap, pop3 and smtp
