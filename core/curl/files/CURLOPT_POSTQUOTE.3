.SH NAME
CURLOPT_POSTQUOTE \- (S)FTP commands to run after the transfer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_POSTQUOTE,
                          struct curl_slist *cmds);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a linked list of FTP or SFTP commands to pass to the server
after your FTP transfer request. The commands are only issued if no error
occur. The linked list should be a fully valid list of struct curl_slist
structs properly filled in as described for \fICURLOPT_QUOTE(3)\fP.

Using this option multiple times makes the last set list override the previous
ones. Set it to NULL to disable its use again.

libcurl does not copy the list, it needs to be kept around until after the
transfer has completed.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL
.SH PROTOCOLS
This functionality affects ftp and sftp
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
int main(void)
{
  struct curl_slist *cmdlist = NULL;
  cmdlist = curl_slist_append(cmdlist, "RNFR source-name");
  cmdlist = curl_slist_append(cmdlist, "RNTO new-name");

  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    CURLcode res;
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "ftp://example.com/foo.bin");

    /* pass in the FTP commands to run after the transfer */
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTQUOTE, cmdlist);

    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

    curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
  }
  curl_slist_free_all(cmdlist);
}
