.SH NAME
CURLOPT_PROXY_TLS13_CIPHERS \- ciphers suites for proxy TLS 1.3
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PROXY_TLS13_CIPHERS,
                          char *list);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char pointer, pointing to a null\-terminated string holding the list of
cipher suites to use for the TLS 1.3 connection to a proxy. The list must be
syntactically correct, it consists of one or more cipher suite strings
separated by colons.

For setting TLS 1.2 (1.1, 1.0) ciphers see \fICURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_CIPHER_LIST(3)\fP.

A valid example of a cipher list is:
.nf
"TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256"
.fi

Find more details about cipher lists on this URL:

 https://curl.se/docs/ssl\-ciphers.html

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.

Using this option multiple times makes the last set string override the
previous ones. Set it to NULL to disable its use again.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL, use internal built\-in list
.SH PROTOCOLS
This functionality affects all TLS based protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.

This option works only with the following TLS backends:
OpenSSL, mbedTLS, rustls and wolfSSL
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
int main(void)
{
  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    CURLcode res;
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PROXY_TLS13_CIPHERS,
                     "TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256");
    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
    curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
  }
}
.fi
.SH HISTORY
OpenSSL support added in 7.61.0, available when built with OpenSSL >= 1.1.1.
LibreSSL support added in 8.3.0, available when built with LibreSSL >= 3.4.1.
wolfSSL support added in 8.10.0.
mbedTLS support added in 8.10.0, available when built with mbedTLS >= 3.6.0.
Rustls support added in 8.10.0.

Before curl 8.10.0 with mbedTLS or wolfSSL, TLS 1.3 cipher suites were set
by using the \fICURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_CIPHER_LIST(3)\fP option.
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in curl 7.61.0
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if supported, CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN otherwise.
