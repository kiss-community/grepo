.SH NAME
CURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE \- type of client SSL certificate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE, char *type);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a null\-terminated string as parameter. The string should be
the format of your certificate.

Supported formats are "PEM" and "DER", except with Secure Transport or
Schannel. OpenSSL (versions 0.9.3 and later), Secure Transport (on iOS 5 or
later, or macOS 10.7 or later) and Schannel support "P12" for PKCS#12\-encoded
files. GnuTLS supports P12 starting with curl 8.11.0.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.

Using this option multiple times makes the last set string override the
previous ones. Set it to NULL restores back to internal default.
.SH DEFAULT
\&"PEM"
.SH PROTOCOLS
This functionality affects all TLS based protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.

This option works only with the following TLS backends:
GnuTLS, OpenSSL, Schannel, Secure Transport, mbedTLS and wolfSSL
