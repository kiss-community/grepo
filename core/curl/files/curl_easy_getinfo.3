.SH NAME
curl_easy_getinfo \- extract information from a curl handle
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *curl, CURLINFO info, ... );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Get the \fIinfo\fP kept in the \fIcurl\fP handle. The third argument \fBMUST\fP be
pointing to the specific type of the used option which is documented in each
man page of the \fIinfo\fP option. The data is stored accordingly and can be
relied upon only if this function returns CURLE_OK. Use this function after a
performed transfer if you want to get transfer related data.

You should not free the memory returned by this function unless it is
explicitly mentioned below.
