.SH NAME
curl_mime_filename \- set a mime part\(aqs remote filename
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_mime_filename(curl_mimepart *part,
                            const char *filename);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcurl_mime_filename(3)\fP sets a mime part\(aqs remote filename. When remote
filename is set, content data is processed as a file, whatever is the part\(aqs
content source. A part\(aqs remote filename is transmitted to the server in the
associated Content\-Disposition generated header.

\fIpart\fP is the part\(aqs handle to assign the remote filename to.

\fIfilename\fP points to the null\-terminated filename string; it may be set
to NULL to remove a previously attached remote filename.

The remote filename string is copied into the part, thus the associated
storage may safely be released or reused after call. Setting a part\(aqs file
name multiple times is valid: only the value set by the last call is retained.
.SH PROTOCOLS
This functionality affects http, imap and smtp
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf

static char imagebuf[]="imagedata";

int main(void)
{
  curl_mime *mime;
  curl_mimepart *part;

  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    /* create a mime handle */
    mime = curl_mime_init(curl);

    /* add a part */
    part = curl_mime_addpart(mime);

    /* send image data from memory */
    curl_mime_data(part, imagebuf, sizeof(imagebuf));

    /* set a file name to make it look like a file upload */
    curl_mime_filename(part, "image.png");

    /* set name */
    curl_mime_name(part, "data");
  }
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in curl 7.56.0
.SH RETURN VALUE
This function returns a CURLcode indicating success or error.

CURLE_OK (0) means everything was OK, non\-zero means an error occurred, see
