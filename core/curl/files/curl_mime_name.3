.SH NAME
curl_mime_name \- set a mime part\(aqs name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_mime_name(curl_mimepart *part, const char *name);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcurl_mime_name(3)\fP sets a mime part\(aqs name. This is the way HTTP form
fields are named.

\fIpart\fP is the part\(aqs handle to assign a name to.

\fIname\fP points to the null\-terminated name string.

The name string is copied into the part, thus the associated storage may
safely be released or reused after call. Setting a part\(aqs name multiple times
is valid: only the value set by the last call is retained. It is possible to
reset the name of a part by setting \fIname\fP to NULL.
.SH PROTOCOLS
This functionality affects http, imap and smtp
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
int main(void)
{
  curl_mime *mime;
  curl_mimepart *part;

  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    /* create a mime handle */
    mime = curl_mime_init(curl);

    /* add a part */
    part = curl_mime_addpart(mime);

    /* give the part a name */
    curl_mime_name(part, "shoe_size");
  }
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in curl 7.56.0
.SH RETURN VALUE
This function returns a CURLcode indicating success or error.

CURLE_OK (0) means everything was OK, non\-zero means an error occurred, see
\fIlibcurl\-errors(3)\fP. If \fICURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER(3)\fP was set with \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP
there can be an error message stored in the error buffer when non\-zero is
returned.
