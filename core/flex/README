flex
________________________________________________________________________________

Flex (fast lexical analyzer generator) is a free and open-source software
alternative to lex. It is a computer program that generates lexical analyzers
(also known as "scanners" or "lexers"). It is frequently used as the lex
implementation together with Berkeley Yacc parser generator on BSD-derived
operating systems (as both lex and yacc are part of POSIX), or together with GNU
bison (a version of yacc) in *BSD ports and in Linux distributions. Unlike
Bison, flex is not part of the GNU Project and is not released under the GNU
General Public License, although a manual for Flex was produced and published by
the Free Software Foundation. [0]
