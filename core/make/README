make
________________________________________________________________________________

GNU Make (short gmake) is the standard implementation of Make for Linux and
macOS. It provides several extensions over the original Make, such as
conditionals. It also provides many built-in functions which can be used to
eliminate the need for shell-scripting in the makefile rules as well as to
manipulate the variables set and used in the makefile. For example, the foreach
function can be used to iterate over a list of values, such as the names of
files in a given directory. GNU Make is required for building many software
systems, including GCC (since version 3.4), the Linux kernel, LibreOffice and
Mozilla Firefox. [0]
