| This package is actually two packages: freetype and harfbuzz. To circumvent  |
| the circular dependency between them, they have been merged together.        |

FreeType is a popular software development library used to render text onto
bitmaps, and provides support for other font-related operations. The FreeType
font rasterization engine is free and open-source software with the source code
dual-licensed under a BSD-like license and the GPL. FreeType supports a number
of font formats, including TrueType, Type 1, and OpenType and "is designed to
be small, efficient, highly customizable, and portable while capable of
producing high-quality output (glyph images)." [0]

HarfBuzz is a software development library for text shaping, which is the
process of converting Unicode text to glyph indices and positions. The newer
version, New HarfBuzz (2012–), targets various font technologies while the first
version, Old HarfBuzz (2006–2012), targeted only OpenType fonts. [1]
