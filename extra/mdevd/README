mdevd
________________________________________________________________________________

mdevd is a small daemon managing kernel hotplug events, similarly to udevd. It
uses the same configuration file as mdev, which is a hotplug manager integrated
in the Busybox suite of tools. However, mdev needs to be registered in
/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug, and the kernel forks an instance of mdev for every
event; by contrast, mdevd is a daemon and does not fork.

The point of mdevd is to provide a drop-in replacement to mdev that does not
fork, so it can handle large influxes of events at boot time without a
performance drop. mdevd is designed to be entirely compatible with advanced
mdev usage such as $/mdev-like-a-boss. [0]
