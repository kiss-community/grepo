________________________________________________________________________________

Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its
design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant
indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim
to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale
projects.

Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple
programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural),
object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a
"batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library. [0]
